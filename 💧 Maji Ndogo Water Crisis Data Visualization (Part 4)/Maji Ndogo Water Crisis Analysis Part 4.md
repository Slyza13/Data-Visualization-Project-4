### **Project Summary: Launching a Public Monitoring Dashboard for the Maji Ndogo Water Project**

**Objective:** To build a transparent, public-facing Power BI dashboard that tracks the progress, financial expenditure, and impact of the ongoing water source improvement project, providing accountability and insights for both citizens and project managers.

#### **1. Transitioning from Planning to Implementation**

With the project plan approved and funded, the focus shifted from predictive planning to real-time monitoring. A new dataset was provided, containing updated information on the actual progress of the work, including:
*   **Start and Completion Dates** for each improvement.
*   **Actual Costs** incurred, detailing payments to vendors.
*   **Vendor Information,** identifying the companies executing the work on the ground.

#### **2. Designing a Dashboard for Transparency and Management**

The dashboard was designed to serve a dual audience: the **public**, demanding transparency, and **decision-makers**, requiring management oversight. The core questions it answered were:
*   **Progress Tracking:** What percentage of the project is complete? How does this vary by province and town?
*   **Financial Oversight:** How much of the budget has been spent? Are we over or under budget?
*   **Impact Measurement:** How many people have gained access to basic water as a result of the completed work?
*   **Spending Breakdown:** Where is the money being spent, and what is it being spent on?

#### **3. Building the Dashboard with Advanced Analytics**

The dashboard was constructed using sophisticated DAX measures to ensure calculations remained accurate even as users filtered the data by date, province, or town.

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Measures were created to dynamically calculate:
    *   **Project Completion Percentage:** The number of completed projects divided by the total projects, filtered by the selected context (e.g., national, provincial).
    *   **Basic Water Access Percentage:** A complex measure that recalculated the population with basic water access based on UN standards, taking into account the newly functional improved sources.
    *   **Cumulative Budget vs. Actual Cost:** A running total of the budgeted amount versus the actual money spent, plotted over time using a KPI visual to instantly show if the project was over or under budget.

*   **Interactive Map:** A custom shape map of Maji Ndogo was used, with color saturation tied to the project completion percentage. This allowed users to see geographic progress at a glance and click on specific towns for details.

#### **4. Year-One Review: Initial Results and a Budget Warning**

After one year of data was loaded, the dashboard revealed significant insights:
*   **Progress:** The project was 22% complete, increasing basic water access from 34% to 48% of the population.
*   **Budget Concern:** The project was already 10% over budget. Drilling into the data showed that costs in remote provinces like Sokoto were significantly higher than initially forecasted, due to difficult terrain and logistics.

#### **5. Deep-Dive Analysis: Uncovering the Real Story Behind Costs**

A critical analysis was conducted to identify the cause of the budget overrun and potential solutions.

*   **Superficial vs. Contextual Analysis:** A superficial look at vendor costs suggested that the most expensive teams should be replaced. However, a deeper, contextual analysis—filtering by province and improvement type—revealed a different story.
*   **Key Insight on Efficiency:** The analysis uncovered that the most effective vendors were not the cheapest in absolute terms, but were the most efficient within their specific operating contexts. For example, one vendor (Entebbe RO Installers) appeared expensive nationally but was actually the most cost-effective team working in the challenging conditions of rural Sokoto because they minimized travel time by sequentially completing projects in the same area.

#### **6. The Final Update: A Successful Project Conclusion**

After four years, the final data update was processed. The dashboard, without any structural changes, seamlessly incorporated the new data, demonstrating the power of a well-built data model. The project was successfully completed, providing a clear, data-driven narrative of the entire journey from planning to execution.

#### **7. Conclusion: The Power of Data-Driven Decision Making**

The Maji Ndogo water project dashboard served as more than a reporting tool; it was an instrument for transparent governance and intelligent management. The project highlighted several key lessons:
*   **Transparency Builds Trust:** A public dashboard fosters accountability and citizen engagement.
*   **Context is Critical:** Data must be analyzed with the right context to avoid misleading conclusions. The true cost drivers were not individual vendors, but geographic and logistical challenges.
*   **Agile Management:** Real-time data allows project managers to identify trends, diagnose problems, and implement corrective actions quickly, such as advising vendors on optimizing their travel routes to reduce costs.
*   **End-to-End Impact:** The project demonstrated how data skills can be applied to a real-world problem, from initial assessment and planning through to monitoring, evaluation, and successful completion, ultimately improving lives.
