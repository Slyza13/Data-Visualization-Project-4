## 📌 Project Summary
**Objective:** Build a **public-facing Power BI dashboard** to track progress, financial expenditure, and impact of the Maji Ndogo water source improvement project — ensuring **transparency for citizens** and **oversight for decision-makers**.  

This phase represents the **real-time monitoring and accountability** stage of the project.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Transition to Implementation
- Shift from **planning** (predictive analysis) to **real-time monitoring** (execution).
- New dataset included:
  - Start and completion dates  
  - Actual costs + vendor payments  
  - Vendor company information  

### 2. Dual-Purpose Dashboard
- **For the Public:** Transparency and trust through open data access.  
- **For Managers:** Oversight tools for tracking project success and financial efficiency.  

Answered questions:
- ✅ What % of the project is complete?  
- ✅ How much of the budget has been spent?  
- ✅ How many people gained access to water?  
- ✅ Where is the money going?  

### 3. Advanced Analytics & DAX
- **KPIs:** Completion %, Basic Water Access %, Budget vs Actual Spend.  
- **Dynamic filters** by date, province, and town.  
- **Shape Map:** Interactive visualization of project progress by region.  

### 4. Year-One Review
- Progress: 22% completion → water access up from **34% → 48%**.  
- Budget: Already **10% over**, with cost overruns in remote provinces.  

### 5. Deep Dive: Cost Drivers
- Initial assumption: replace high-cost vendors.  
- Contextual insight: vendors like **Entebbe RO Installers** were most efficient in remote Sokoto despite high national costs.  

### 6. Final Update (Year 4)
- **Project completed successfully**.  
- Dashboard seamlessly absorbed final dataset with no structural changes.

## 🚀 Key Lessons
- **Transparency builds trust**: Public dashboards foster accountability.  
- **Context matters**: True cost drivers were geographic, not vendors.  
- **Agile management**: Real-time data enabled quick course corrections.  
- **Impact focused**: End-to-end data story improved lives through better access to water.
